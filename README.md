# Headscale Server on Docker

[![Build Status](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-headscale/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-headscale/actions/workflows/main.yml) &nbsp;[![License: MIT](docs/images/license.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Docker image to run a [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) server — a self-hosted, open-source implementation of the Tailscale coordination server. Connect all your devices using the official Tailscale client apps, with your own server in control.

- Automatically generates server configuration and a pre-auth key on first start
- Manage users, nodes and pre-auth keys via a helper script (`hs_manage`)
- MagicDNS support for seamless hostname resolution across your network
- Persistent data via a Docker volume
- Multi-arch: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`

**Also available:** Docker images for [WireGuard](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-wireguard), [OpenVPN](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-openvpn), [IPsec VPN](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server) and [LiteLLM](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-litellm).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

A publicly reachable server with a domain name and TLS certificate is strongly recommended. See [TLS and reverse proxy](#tls-and-reverse-proxy) for setup options.

### Using Docker

Create a `vpn.env` file. `HS_SERVER_URL` is the HTTPS URL that Tailscale clients use to connect to your server. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) for all options.

```
HS_SERVER_URL=https://hs.example.com
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run \
  --name headscale \
  --restart=always \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp \
  -v headscale-data:/var/lib/headscale \
  -v ./vpn.env:/vpn.env:ro \
  -d hwdsl2/headscale-server
```

**Note:** With the above command, port `8080` is bound to localhost only. A reverse proxy on the host that handles TLS and forwards to `127.0.0.1:8080` is required for Tailscale clients to connect. See [TLS and reverse proxy](#tls-and-reverse-proxy). To expose the port directly instead, replace `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` with `8080:8080`.

On first start, the container will:
1. Generate the server configuration from your environment variables
2. Create the initial user (default: `admin`)
3. Print a **reusable pre-auth key** to the container logs

Retrieve the initial pre-auth key from the logs:

```bash
docker logs headscale
```

Connect a device using the official [Tailscale client](https://tailscale.com/download):

```bash
tailscale up --login-server https://hs.example.com --authkey <key-from-logs>
```

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
cp vpn.env.example vpn.env
nano vpn.env        # Set HS_SERVER_URL at minimum
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs headscale
```

Example `docker-compose.yml` (already included):

```yaml
services:
  headscale:
    image: hwdsl2/headscale-server
    container_name: headscale
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080/tcp"
    volumes:
      - headscale-data:/var/lib/headscale
      - ./vpn.env:/vpn.env:ro

volumes:
  headscale-data:
```

Alternatively, you may [set up Headscale without Docker](https://github.com/hwdsl2/headscale-install). To learn more about how to use this image, read the sections below.

## Download

Get the trusted build from the [Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/hwdsl2/headscale-server/):

```bash
docker pull hwdsl2/headscale-server
```

Alternatively, you may download from [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/hwdsl2/headscale-server):

```bash
docker pull quay.io/hwdsl2/headscale-server
docker image tag quay.io/hwdsl2/headscale-server hwdsl2/headscale-server
```

Supported platforms: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

## Client configuration

Refer to the Headscale documentation for instructions on connecting clients:

- [Android](https://headscale.net/stable/usage/connect/android/)
- [Apple (iOS / macOS)](https://headscale.net/stable/usage/connect/apple/)
- [Windows](https://headscale.net/stable/usage/connect/windows/)

## Environment variables

All variables are optional. `HS_SERVER_URL` is strongly recommended for production use.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HS_SERVER_URL` | auto-detected | URL that Tailscale clients connect to (e.g. `https://hs.example.com`). Must be HTTPS for full client functionality. |
| `HS_LISTEN_PORT` | `8080` | TCP port the server listens on. |
| `HS_METRICS_PORT` | `9090` | Prometheus metrics port. Set to empty to disable. |
| `HS_BASE_DOMAIN` | `headscale.internal` | Base domain for MagicDNS hostnames (e.g. `myhost.headscale.internal`). Must not equal or be a parent domain of the hostname in `HS_SERVER_URL` (e.g. if `HS_SERVER_URL=https://hs.example.com`, do not use `example.com`). |
| `HS_USERNAME` | `admin` | Name of the first user created on initial setup. |
| `HS_DNS_SRV1` | `1.1.1.1` | Primary DNS server pushed to clients via MagicDNS. Accepts IPv4 or IPv6. |
| `HS_DNS_SRV2` | `1.0.0.1` | Secondary DNS server pushed to clients via MagicDNS. |
| `HS_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log verbosity: `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`. |

**Note:** In your `env` file, you may enclose values in single quotes, e.g. `VAR='value'`. Do not add spaces around `=`.

The configuration file is regenerated on each container start. To change a setting, update `vpn.env` and restart the container. The env file is bind-mounted into the container, so changes are picked up on every restart without recreating the container.

## TLS and reverse proxy

Tailscale clients work best with HTTPS. The recommended setup is to run a reverse proxy in front of Headscale that handles TLS termination, then set `HS_SERVER_URL` to your HTTPS URL.

Use one of the following addresses to reach the Headscale container from your reverse proxy:

- **`headscale:8080`** — if your reverse proxy runs as a container in the **same Docker network** as Headscale (e.g. defined in the same `docker-compose.yml`). Docker resolves the container name automatically.
- **`127.0.0.1:8080`** — if your reverse proxy runs **on the host** and port `8080` is published (the default `docker-compose.yml` publishes it).

**Note:** Do not use the container's internal IP address obtained from `docker inspect`. That IP address changes every time the container is recreated.

**Example with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) ([Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy))** (automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt, reverse proxy in the same Docker network):

`Caddyfile`:
```
hs.example.com {
  reverse_proxy headscale:8080
}
```

**Example with nginx** (reverse proxy on the host):

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name hs.example.com;

  ssl_certificate     /path/to/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

Set `HS_SERVER_URL=https://hs.example.com` in your `vpn.env` and restart the container.

**Ports to open in your firewall:**

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `8080` | TCP | Headscale coordination server (or your reverse proxy port) |
| `443` | TCP | HTTPS (if using a reverse proxy) |
| `9090` | TCP | Prometheus metrics (optional, not published by default) |

## Managing the server

Use the `hs_manage` helper to manage users and nodes from the host without entering the container.

**Register a node by its node key:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --registernode <key> --user admin
```

**Add a user:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --adduser alice
```

**Delete a user:**

```bash
docker exec -it headscale hs_manage --deleteuser alice
# Or skip the confirmation prompt:
docker exec headscale hs_manage --deleteuser alice --yes
```

**Create a pre-auth key for a user:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --createkey --user alice
```

**List users:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --listusers
```

**List all registered nodes:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --listnodes
```

**List nodes for a specific user:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --listnodes --user alice
```

**Delete a node by ID:**

```bash
docker exec -it headscale hs_manage --deletenode 3
# Or skip the confirmation prompt:
docker exec headscale hs_manage --deletenode 3 --yes
```

**List all pre-auth keys:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --listkeys
```

**Show help:**

```bash
docker exec headscale hs_manage --help
```

You can also run Headscale commands directly using `docker exec headscale headscale <command>`. Run `docker exec headscale headscale -h` or refer to the [Headscale documentation](https://headscale.net/) for available commands.

## Update Docker image

To update the Docker image and container, first [download](#download) the latest version:

```bash
docker pull hwdsl2/headscale-server
```

If the Docker image is already up to date, you should see:

```
Status: Image is up to date for hwdsl2/headscale-server:latest
```

Otherwise, it will download the latest version. Remove and re-create the container using instructions from [Quick start](#quick-start). Your data is preserved in the `headscale-data` volume.
